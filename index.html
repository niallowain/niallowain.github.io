	<h1> Autumn 2020 Question 1(d)</h1>

	<p><i>The current share price of a company is €50. The share price has volatility 20%.
The risk-free interest rate is 5% per annum. Use the Black-Scholes Formula to
compute the price of a European call option on the stock with strike price €53 that
expires in three months’ time.</i><p>
<p> The <b>Black-Scholes</b> Formula for a European Call Option on an asset whose price at time \(t\) is\( S(t)\) </p>
<p>
$$(C(t,S(t)) = S(t)\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d2)$$ </p>
<p>
Where \(K\) is the strike price, \(r\) is the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate, \(\sigma\) is the volatility of the asset, 
</p>
<p>
$$d_1 = {log(S(t)/K)+(r+{1 \over 2}\sigma^2)(T-t) \over \sigma \sqrt{T-t}}$$
</p>
<p>\(d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T-t}\) and \(\Phi\) is the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution </p>

<h3> Figures for this question </h3>
<p>$$\sigma = 0.2$$</p>
<p>$$S(0) = €50$$</p>
<p>$$K = €53$$</p>
<p>$$T-t = {3 \over 12}$$</p>

<p> So for this question, \(d_1\) = </p>
<p>$${ln({50 \over 53})+(0.05+{1 \over 2}0.2^2)({3 \over 12}) \over 0.2\sqrt{3 \over 12}}$$
</p>
<p>$$= -0.407689$$</p>
<p>This subsequently means...</p>
<p>$$d_2 = -0.407689 - 0.2\sqrt{3 \over 12} = -0.507689 $$</p>
<p><b>We Return now to </b>\((C(t,S(t)) = S(t)\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d2)\)</p>
<p>$$= 50\Phi(-0.40769) - 53e^{-0.05({3 \over 12})}\Phi(-0.506789)$$</p>
<p><b>Using Log Tables</b></p>
<p>$$=50(0.3409) -53(0.9876)(0.3050)$$</p>
<p>$$=€1.08$$</p>
	
	
	<h1> Autumn 2020 Question 2 (b)</h1>
	<p>Prove the put-call parity formula \( S(t) + P (t) − C(t) = Ke^{ −r(T −t)}\) where r is the
risk-free interest rate, and where \( S(t), P (t), C(t)\) are the time t prices of the stock,
the put option, and the call option, respectively.</p>
	<p><b>This is Theorem 7.1 in the book</b></p>

</p>For a stock that pays no dividends the following relation holds between the
prices of European call and put options, both with exercise price X and exercise
time T :</p>
<p>$$C^E - P^E = S(0) - Xe^{-rT}$$</p>

<h3>Proof</h3>

<p>Suppose that</p>
<p>$$C^E - P^E > S(0) - Xe^{-rT}$$</p>
<p> In this case an arbitrage strategy can be constructed as follows: At time 0</p>
<ol>
	<li>Buy one share for S(0)</li>
	<li>Buy one put option for \(P^E\)</li>
	<li>Write and sell one call option for \(C^E\)</li>
	<li>Invest the sum \(C^E-P^E-S(0)\) (or borrow, if negative) on the money market at the interest rate \(r\).</li>
</ol>
<p>The balance of these transactions is 0. Then, at time \(T\)</p>
<ol>
	<li>Close out the money market position, collecting (or paying, if negative) the sum \((C^E-P^E-S(0))e^{rT}\)</li>
	<li> Sell the share for X either by exercising the put if \(S(T)\leq X\) or settling the short position in calls if \(S(T) > X\).</li>
</ol>
<p>The balance will be  \((C^E-P^E-S(0))e^{rT} + X\), which is positive from what we have supposed at proof start, <b>Contradicting the No-Arbitrage Principle</b> </p>

<p>Now suppose that</p>
<p>$$C^E - P^E <  S(0) - Xe^{-rT}$$</p>

<p>Then the following reverse strategy will result in arbitrage: At time 0</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sell short one share for S(0)</li>
	<li>Write and sell a put option for \(P^E\)</li>
	<li>Buy one call option for \(C^E\)</li>
	<li>Invest the sum \(S(0)-C^E+P^E\) (or borrow, if negative) on the money market at the interest rate \(r\).</li>
</ol>
<p>The balance of these transaction is 0, at time \(T\)</p>
<ol>
	<li> Close out the money market position, collecting (or paying, if negative) the sum (\(S(0) - C^E + P^E)e^{rT}\)</li>
	<li>Buy one share for \(X\) either by exercising the call is \(S(T) > X\) or setting the short psoition in puts if \(S(T) \leq X \) and close the short position in stock.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The balance will be \((S(0) - C^E + P^E)e^{rT}-X\), positive for this supposition, once again contradicting the No-Arbitrage Principle</h5>

<h1>Autumn 2020 Question 2(c)</h1>
	<p>Starting from the Black-Scholes formula for the price \(C(t)\) of a call option, use put-
call parity to derive the Black-Scholes formula for the price \( P(t)\) of the corresponding
put option.</p>
	<p>
$$(C(t,S(t)) = S(t)\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d2)$$ </p>
	<p>Put-Call Parity tells us that \(S(t) + P (t) − C(t) = Ke^{ −r(T −t)}\)</p>
	<p>From this, we can say  \(S(t) + P(t) − C(t,S(t)) = Ke^{ −r(T −t)}\)</p> 
	<p>
	$$S(t) + P(t) - (C(t,S(t)) = S(t) + P(t) -  S(t)\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d2) = Ke^{-r(T-t)} $$ </p>
		<p>
	$$ S(t)(1- \Phi(d_1)) + P(t)= Ke^{-r(T-t)}(1 + \Phi(d2)) $$ </p>
		<p>$$P(t,S(t)) =  Ke^{-r(T-t)}(1 + \Phi(d2)) -  S(t)(1- \Phi(d_1)) $$ </p>
